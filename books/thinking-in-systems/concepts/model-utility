QUESTIONS FOR TESTING THE VALUE OF A MODEL
1. Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
2. If they did, would the system react this way?
3. What is driving the driving factors?

Model utility depends not on whether its
driving scenarios are realistic (since no
one can know that for sure), but on
whether it responds in ways that match our understanding of reality, 
even when placed in hypothetical scenarios.
