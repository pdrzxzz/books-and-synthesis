# How to read a Book

## Inspectional Reading

### **A. Systematic Skimming (Pre-reading)**

1. **Look at the title page and preface**
   â€“ What kind of book is it? Whatâ€™s its purpose?

2. **Study the table of contents**
   â€“ This gives you the bookâ€™s structure and main topics.

3. **Check the index (if any)**
   â€“ Look at recurring terms, names, or concepts.

4. **Read the publisherâ€™s blurb or introduction (if by the author)**
   â€“ Sometimes biased, but it often frames the bookâ€™s main idea.

5. **Skim a few pivotal chapters**
   â€“ Especially the beginning, ending, and any especially central ones.

6. **Turn the pages, dipping in here and there**
   â€“ Glance at summaries, subheadings, bold/italicized words, diagrams, and conclusion paragraphs.

ðŸ‘‰ The goal: **get a general idea of what the book is about and how itâ€™s structured**â€”not to absorb details.

### **B. Superficial Reading**

7. **Read the book through without stopping to look things up.**  
   â€“ Donâ€™t get stuck on passages you donâ€™t fully understand.  
   â€“ Push forward to get the gist, even if some things remain unclear.  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal: **grasp the whole before diving into details**.

## Analytical Reading

### **Stage 1: Classify the Book (What kind of book is it?)**

1. **Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.**

   * Is it practical or theoretical?
   * If theoretical, is it history, science, or philosophy?
   * Narrow down further into sub-categories.

2. **State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.**

   * Summarize its main theme in a sentence or two.

3. **Enumerate its major parts in order and relation.**

   * Make an outline of the structure (like a map of the book).

4. **Define the problem(s) the author is trying to solve.**

   * Ask: What questions is the author addressing?

### **Stage 2: Interpret the Bookâ€™s Contents (What is being said and how?)**

5. **Come to terms with the author by interpreting key words.**

   * Identify important words and understand them in the way the author uses them.

6. **Grasp the authorâ€™s propositions.**

   * Translate important sentences into your own words.

7. **Know the authorâ€™s arguments.**

   * Find the reasoning and evidence that supports their conclusions.

8. **Determine which problems the author has solved and which remain unsolved.**

   * See how successful the author is at answering the central questions.

### **Stage 3: Criticize the Book as a Communication of Knowledge (Is it true?)**

9. **Do not criticize before you can say you understand.**

   * Fairness requires full comprehension first.

10. **Do not disagree until you can state the authorâ€™s position in your own words.**

    * Be able to explain their case as well as they could.

11. **Respect the difference between knowledge and opinion.**

    * Ask: Is this claim demonstrable fact, or the authorâ€™s personal viewpoint?

### **Stage 4: Determine the Bookâ€™s Significance (What of it?)**

12. **Show where the author is uninformed.**

    * They may be missing relevant knowledge.

13. **Show where the author is misinformed.**

    * They may have facts wrong.

14. **Show where the author is illogical.**

    * Their reasoning may not hold up.

15. **Show where the authorâ€™s analysis is incomplete.**

    * They may fail to consider all aspects of the problem.
