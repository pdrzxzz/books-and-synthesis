Simple:

Flows are like the faucet and the drain of a bathtub â€” the faucet pours water in (inflow), and the drain lets water out (outflow). 
They control how much goes into or out of a stock, like toys in a box or money in a piggy bank.
Flows are what make the amount of stuff grow or shrink over time.

Complex:

Flows are what move material, energy, or information into or out of the system.
Every stock is affected by at least one inflow (which adds to it) and one outflow (which removes from it). 
They are dynamic and can change quickly, while stocks tend to change more slowly because they accumulate over time.
