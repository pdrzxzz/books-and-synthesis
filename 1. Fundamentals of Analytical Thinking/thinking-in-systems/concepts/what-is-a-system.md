A system is a set of things—people, cells,
molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce
their own pattern of behavior over time. The system may be buffeted,
constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system’s
response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is
seldom simple in the real world.

A system is like a big team where everyone works together. Imagine your toys all connected by strings — when you move one, the others move too. How the toys move depends on how the strings are tied. So, a system is a bunch of things connected that work together and react when something outside pulls or pushes them. It’s like a little world where everything is linked!
