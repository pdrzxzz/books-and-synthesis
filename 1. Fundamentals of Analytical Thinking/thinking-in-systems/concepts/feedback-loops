Feedback is a process where a change in a systemâ€™s stock affects the flow into or out of that same stock, creating a loop.
These loops are entirely internal to the system, and they shape how the system respond to internal or external changes over time.

There are two main types: 
balancing (negative) feedback loops, which try to keep the system stable by counteracting change 
(like a thermostat keeping a room at the same temperature), 
and reinforcing (positive) feedback loops, which amplify change and drive growth or collapse 
(like compound interest or a snowball rolling downhill).
